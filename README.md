video-id-extractor


For a website project I had written a simple regex in Ruby for processing youtube urls in order to save the id to the database and
easily be able to retrieve thumbnails and switch videos in the player. This is the same idea but with JavaScript. The function takes two parameters the url and a boolean for whether or not the thumbnail is desired. The index file is a simple demo of the function.
